<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Before diving into the steps, let's prepare for success. Grab a few essential items to make your sleep more comfortable and effective.

Ensure your bedroom is a sleep-friendly environment with minimal noise and distractions.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<h3>1. Choose the Right Sleep Position</h3>
<p>Deciding on the right sleep position is crucial. If you're a side sleeper, lie on the side that doesn't hurt. Place a pillow between your knees to keep your hips aligned.</p>

<h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
<p>Use a firm body pillow to support your entire body, maintaining a straight line from head to toe.</p>

<h3>2. Use Supportive Pillows</h3>
<p>Pillows aren't just for your head. Use them strategically to support your hips and lower back. For back sleepers, placing a pillow under your knees can relieve pressure on your hips.</p>

<h3>Pro Tip:</h3>

<h3>3. Adjust Your Mattress</h3>
