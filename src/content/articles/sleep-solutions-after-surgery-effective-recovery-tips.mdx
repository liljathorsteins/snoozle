Besides considering your sleeping position and making your environment recovery-friendly, incorporating certain sleep accessories can enhance comfort and promote healing. For instance, a Bamboo Cooling Mattress Protector can offer a dual benefit of keeping you cool while also being waterproof, safeguarding your bed from any unexpected spills during the night. Moreover, a Memory Foam Sleep Positioning Pillow is highly recommended for side sleepers, particularly when rolling onto your side may relieve pressure and reduce discomfort. Such ergonomic design helps maintain proper posture, critical for reducing pressure points common after surgery. These thoughtful additions can make your nights more restful and less stressful.
