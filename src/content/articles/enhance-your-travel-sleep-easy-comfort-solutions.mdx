<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We all know the struggle of trying to catch some z's while traveling. Whether it's a long-haul flight or a road trip, getting quality sleep on the go can be challenging.

<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Before diving into specific solutions, it's essential to assess your current sleep situation. Are you a light sleeper, or do you struggle with noise? Do you find it hard to get comfortable in new environments? Understanding your sleep challenges will help you tailor the right strategies and products for your needs. Gather any travel essentials you already own, like earplugs or eye masks, and make a list of additional items you may need based on our recommendations.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<h3>1. Prepare Your Sleep Environment</h3>
<p>Creating a conducive sleep environment is crucial, even when you're away from home.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Invest in a good travel pillow:</strong> A supportive travel pillow can make a world of difference. Consider options like wedge pillows for better neck support (<a href="https://amzn.to/3FhMB4a">view on Amazon</a>).</li>

  <li><strong>Control light exposure:</strong> Use an eye mask to keep out any unwanted light.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Maintain a Consistent Routine</h3>
<p>Sticking to your usual bedtime routine can signal to your body that it's time to sleep, even in a different time zone. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, and incorporate familiar pre-sleep activities like reading or meditating.</p>

<h3>3. Optimize Your Sleep Position</h3>
<p>A comfortable sleep position is key to resting well. If you're sleeping in a bed, consider using a Snoozle Slide Sheet to help with turning and repositioning.
